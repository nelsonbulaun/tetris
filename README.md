<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
React built Tetris project. Using components from Conner Ardman's video ["3 Hours Coding Tetris Condensed To 20 Minutes | React.js"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuzcvFVH4DQ), was initially used as a base to understand how the gameboard and pieces could be implmented, then was built upon further by myself to practice using React and CSS as well as create a more exciting user experience. Enjoy!


Sounds used:
* Main Menu Song sourced from "Tetris In-Flight"
* Sound Effects are sourced from "Tetris 99"

## Future Improvements
* Implementation of a multiplayer game mode, similar to that Jstris or Tetris Battles, will be considered through creating a back-end, to emit socket information to and from users connected on the client side. 
* Sound effects can often be delayed and/or omitted upon continuous call, and will be looked upon for fixing in the meantime.
